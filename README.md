## The 0 Attribution" Bare License:

The "No Attribution" or "-0" license is a modification to the
usual MIT license that also removes the requirement for attribution. It is
roughly the same as an MIT license consisting of a sandwich of
(paragraph, line, paragraph), but it is missing the middle line of the
'sandwich'.

### Rationale

The license may also be useful for code that is intended for
developers to use as reference, teaching samples, examples, or
base templates that other developers may modify for their own other purposes.

In many of these cases, the initial developer may not want to impose
even the cost of attribution, or the use cases may not be conducive to
attribution. While wanting the benefits of MIT-N Style terms.

The CC0 and various "do what you want" licenses and various public
domain dedications may be less attractive to the initial developer for
various reasons (i.e., a bare license is preferable to other license domains)
  The MIT license with all the attribution requirement
language removed also addresses this need. In the same way that ISC Licenses (+Rights afforded after the Berne Convention) could, if similarly modified. 


### Additional Information

While researching prior to publishing this repo, an alternative option was discovered
<https://romanrm.net/mit-zero>, which is an independent
formulation and publication of a similar idea. 
 
(the License Agreement File work itself shall eventually be available under any & every possible combination for dual/multi-license options including but not restricted to fallback terms of the WTFPL, Unlicense, MIT-0, and CC0.)
